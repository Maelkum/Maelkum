## About me

I'm a distributed systems engineer that takes pride in always being curious and itchy to look under the hood. Passionate about programming and engineering. Years of experience in Go, C and Perl, with some excursions in C++, Python and a bunch of other stuff. If I'm not tinkering with tech, I'm probably outdoors, fishing 🎣 or hiking 🥾.

Available for hire.
